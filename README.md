### Loan Calculator

This web application lets the user input the loan amount, the interest of the loan and the 
amount for each instalment and it provides the number of instalments along with the instalment amounts
(the last one can differ) while at the same time calculating the annual interest increaments of the total
amount that needs to be paid.

It is just a simple web application written in TypeScript and React.

You can see it online at https://eoikonomou.github.io/loan-calculator.
